<h1>Vitamin D</h1>
<p>
Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, and many other biological effects. In humans, the most important compounds in this group are vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol).</p>

<h4>Mortality, all-causes</h4>
Vitamin D3 supplementation has been tentatively found to lead to a reduced risk of death in the elderly, but the effect has not been deemed pronounced, or certain enough, to make taking supplements recommendable.
<h4>Bone health</h4>
In general, no good evidence supports the commonly held belief that vitamin D supplements can help prevent osteoporosis.
Its general use for prevention of this disease in those without vitamin D deficiency is thus likely not needed.
<h4>Cancer</h4>
Potential associations have been found between low vitamin D levels and the risk of developing several types of cancer.
Meta-analyses of observational studies have found reduced risk of cancer incidence related to vitamin D intake and 25(OH)D levels, particularly for colorectal cancer, although the strength of the associations was classified as weak.
